# Public Repository - iceicelogan
This is a repository to store my personal projects. I've divided them into overall folders for the two main languages I use, Python and R, and further into what types of file they are.

Links to the two main folders can be found below.

[R](https://github.com/iceicelogan/public/R)

I'll add a few of my favorite visualizations below as well.
