# Public Repository - iceicelogan
This is a repository to store my personal projects. I've divided them into overall folders for the two main languages I use, [Python](https://github.com/iceicelogan/public/tree/master/Python) and [R](https://github.com/iceicelogan/public/tree/master/R), and further into what types of file they are.

***

I'll add a few of my favorite visualizations here, but more live within the above linked folders.
